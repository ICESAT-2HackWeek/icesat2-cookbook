It uses a variety of techniques to shrink the window to the smallest size that contains the surface without clipping off any signal photons.\n\nThere’s a general philosophy that went into the design of ATL06:\n\nUse the best available information to identiy the surface\n\nIf there’s a chance that we’ve found a weak surface return, report it\n\nProvide enough parameters that users can decide which returns are worth using, and which are not\n\nWhen there are no thick clouds between ICESat-2 and the surface, finding the surface return and reporting its height is straightforward: ATL03 provides a tight cluster of high-confidence photons, and ATL06 calculates a weighted average of their heights.\n\nOnce clouds start to block some of the laser light, the number of photons that return to ATLAS from each return becomes progressively smaller.  Unfortunately, even if there are no laser photons to measure, during daylight there is no shortage of other photons to track, which come primarily from sunlight reflecting ground and from clouds.  ATLAS does a very good job of filtering out almost all of these photons, but on a sunny day, over a white surface, the measured background rate can be as high as 12 MHz.  Converting to dimensions that we’ll be seeing this is:\\frac{1.2\\times10^7 photons}{second} \\times \\frac{1 second}{1.5\\times10^8 m} = \\frac{1 photon}{12.5 m}\n\nThis doesn’t sound like a lot, but over a 10-meter-high window that’s 40 m long (typical for the kind of windows you might use to look for the surface if you didn’t know where to find it) we can expect to find 45 photons.\n\nUnlike surface-return photons, background photons are uniformally distributed in height, and any clustering of these photons will be due to random chance.  When the signal quality is marginal, ATL03 may flag photons only as low- and medium- confidence for a particular segment, or may flag no photons at all.  If ATL03 hasn’t told ATL06 which photons are the surface, the algorithm uses a backup signal-finding strategy that initializes surface finding using the strongest cluster of photons available.  It then attempts to converge its surface window on a tight cluster of photons.  This occasionally works, but if there really is no signal, the size of the window generally remains large, and we can evaluate the results based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of whatever ends up inside the window.  Only those segments with at least 10 photons, for which the probability of converging to an SNR equal to the observed SNR or better for random-noise inputs is less thatn 5% are reported.  This cuts down on false positives considerably.\n\nLet’s take a look at some data from Antarctica to see what different problematic data might look like.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/filtering#background-atl06-signal-processing","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Cloud effects on ICESat-2 data,  and Data Filtering","lvl3":"Geographic Setting","lvl2":"Background: ATL06 signal processing"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/notebooks/filtering#geographic-setting","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Cloud effects on ICESat-2 data,  and Data Filtering","lvl3":"Geographic Setting","lvl2":"Background: ATL06 signal processing"},"content":"We’ll be working on Cook Ice Shelf, a heavily crevassed and rifted ice shelf that drains East Antarctica.

The photons in ATL03 come from vertical bands of data (telemetry bands) that the algorithms running onboard ATLAS have identified as possibly containing a ground return.  In some cases the algorithm is correct (e.g. cycle 8), in other cases it returns only a band of photons far from the ground (gt 10 for cycles 7 and 9) or returns a band of photons that contains the ground for which there is no usable return (gt 20 for cycles 7 and 9).\n\nWe can also see bands of photons above the ground in gt 10 for cycles 7 and 8: these are most likely clouds, and the photons in these bands are much farther apart than the photons from true ground returns (see cycle 8).\n\nAll of the tracks contain at least some background photons, which are uniformly distributed over the telemetry bands.  If you check the dates for the different cycles, you’ll see that cycle 7 comes from June (Antarctic winter), cycle 8 comes from mid September (late winter / early spring) and cycle 9 comes from mid December (high summer).  As a result, there are very few background photons in cycle 7, and very many in cycle 9.\n\n","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/filtering#getting-atl03-data-for-a-problematic-track","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Cloud effects on ICESat-2 data,  and Data Filtering","lvl4":"Plotting ATL03 signal classifications","lvl3":"ICESat-2 data over Cook Ice Shelf","lvl2":"Background: ATL06 signal processing"},"type":"lvl4","url":"/notebooks/filtering#plotting-atl03-signal-classifications","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Cloud effects on ICESat-2 data,  and Data Filtering","lvl4":"Plotting ATL03 signal classifications","lvl3":"ICESat-2 data over Cook Ice Shelf","lvl2":"Background: ATL06 signal processing"},"content":"It’s instructive to see how the ATL03 classification algorithm sees these points.
