    "We serve ICESat-2 research communities that are dedicated to creating, sharing, and analyzing public data. We especially aim to support small, underrepresented, or under-resourced communities. Our mission is focused on solving problems through collaborative, multidisciplinary effort. As such, we require comprehensive structures to enable community buy-in, support contributing community members, and maintain organizational goals. Empowered by similar principles as the Wikimedia Foundation and Pangeo, our community governance will be led by our \\textit{Leadership Team} consistent of the Project PI team, a delegate from Radiant Earth, and two delegates from 2i2c, to participate actively in monthly meetings where we review StratusGeo advancements and changes within the community \\citep{aaltonen2015building, stern2022pangeo}. We will seek broader guidance from key developers and scientific advisors to serve as a preliminary step towards an oversight board (see the Letters of Support for examples of such individuals). While we have developed community standards of practice in our JupyterBook, growing our governance beyond the roles of individual community members to a comprehensive structure of community members, contributors, leadership, and advisors, is a critical step of our mission that will occur in our launch of StratusGeo. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a product standpoint, our cloud workflows are hosted on GitHub and freely accessible to any interested parties. Continuous JupyterHub access is freely provided to all users who are verified geoscience researchers, which includes scalable access to 32 Gb cloud instances and a small NVIDIA Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). This democratizes access to compute that is often greater than users would have on personal laptops. Users have the option of using their own cloud credits to access larger compute options. We will continue to request that users keep persistent Elastic Data Storage below 10 Gb, but work with our users as specific needs evolve. Collaboration with Radiant Earth provides free storage services for long term derived data storage and production. While StratusGeo will be fiscally sponsored through POSE, individual users can bring their own cloud-credits or contribute funds to boost their computational resources. We note that individual contributions of this kind will not automatically make a user responsible for StratusGeo operations or compel users to take on an active leadership role. "
